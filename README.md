### A Memory game developed in html, css and javascript.

## The Assignment
- Create a memory game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with no third-party frameworks like jQuery)
- The cards should be randomly positioned before a new game start
- The game must include a replay button that reorder the cards randomly, (using Javascript and not through a page reload!)


## How to try it out
- Clone/download the repository from GitHub
- Open the folder you just cloned
- Open the index.html file in your browser of choice


### If needed - here are the basics...
- Begin the game by clicking one of the cards marked with the LOTR-logo
- Find the 8 pairs
- Play again!

- The game contains background music, if you want to - pause it using the button in the upper left corner
